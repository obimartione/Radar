# Arduino Radar Project

This project utilizes Arduino to create a radar system that detects objects and emits a sound signal through a buzzer when an object is detected. The radar system operates by sending out ultrasonic waves and measuring the time it takes for the waves to bounce back from nearby objects.

## Features

1. Detection of objects within a certain range
2. Audible alert through the buzzer when an object is detected
3. Servo motor for rotating the radar to cover a wider area

## Hardware Requirements

1. Arduino Uno board
2. Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
3. Buzzer
4. Servo motor
5. Jumper wires
6. Breadboard


## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE

## Installation
1. Connect the components as per the circuit diagram provided in the project repository.
2. Upload the Arduino sketch (code) to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
3. Power up the Arduino board.

## Usage

1. Turn on the radar system.
2. The ultrasonic sensor continuously sends out ultrasonic waves.
3. When an object is detected within the specified range, the buzzer emits a sound signal.
4. The servo motor rotates the radar to scan the surrounding area.

## Future Enhancements

1. Integration with additional sensors for improved object detection accuracy.
2. Implementation of data logging capabilities for recording detected objects.
3. Development of a user interface for configuring radar settings.
